 * element on the page. For our implementation, the only piece of content that can
 * overlap the <Aside /> is an image. and only 1 image at a time!
 *
 * So, this calculates the position of its children and the currently viewable <img />
 * and decides wether or not they're overlapping (with some buffer). If they are overlapping
 * we want to hide the top element.
